      <h3 id="the-research">What we do</h3>
<p>
This host performs Internet-wide scans of a number of protocols on the public Internet as part of a research collaboration between network reseaerchers at the University of Sydney and the University of Twente. We are a group of researchers who study the Internet to obtain insights on components, dependencies, and how network entities relate to each other.

You can find more details about the motivation of our project <a href="https://www.catrin.nl/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="which-sites">Which IP addresses do we scan?</h3>
<p>We perform active scans on the entire routed IPv4 address space excluding the <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv4-special-registry/iana-ipv4-special-registry.xhtml" target="_blank">IANA IPv4 Special-Purpose Address Registry</a> and <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/multicast-addresses/multicast-addresses.xhtml" target="_blank">IANA Multicast Address Space Registry</a>.</p>

<h3 id="duration">How long will our scans last?</h3>
<p>This is an ongoing effort, with project funding until at least 2026.</p>

<h3 id="results--responsible-disclosure">Ethics approval and data storage</h3>
<p>All measurement data and all results of our analyses are stored securely in a locally operated data centre. We publish our results at a number of venues, where possible with attached data sets for reproducibility. For some recent results, please check out our <a href="https://www.utwente.nl/en/eemcs/dacs/publications/">publications site</a>.</p>

<p>Our research effort has been approved by the responsible Ethics Committees. Our ethics application describes how we minimize impact on other Internet entities and how we carry out our research in a responsible and ethical manner.
