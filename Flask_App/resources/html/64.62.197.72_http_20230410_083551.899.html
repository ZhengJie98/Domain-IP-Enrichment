<h2>The Shadowserver Foundation</h2><p></p>
<p>If you are looking at this page, then more than likely, you noticed a scan coming from this server across your network and/or poking at a service that you have running.</p>

<p>The Shadowserver Foundation is currently undertaking a project to search for publicly accessible devices that have services running that should not be exposed because they are trivial to exploit or abuse.  The goal of this project is to identify hosts that have these types of services exposed and  <a href="http://www.shadowserver.org/wiki/pmwiki.php/Involve/GetReportsOnYourNetwork">report</a> them back to the network owners for remediation.</p>

<ul>
<li>Further details on this scanning project can be found on our blog at: <a href="https://www.shadowserver.org/news/the-scannings-will-continue-until-the-internet-improves/">https://www.shadowserver.org/news/the-scannings-will-continue-until-the-internet-improves/</a></li>

<li>Statistics on these scans can be found at: <a href="https://www.shadowserver.org/news/of-scannings-and-statistics/">https://www.shadowserver.org/news/of-scannings-and-statistics/</a></li>

<li>If you are curious and would like to explore the data that we collect in a graphical interface, please take a look at our public dashboard: <a href="https://dashboard.shadowserver.org/">https://dashboard.shadowserver.org/</a></li>

<li>If you would like to sign up for reports on any data that we have collected on your network, you can request them from here: <a href="https://www.shadowserver.org/what-we-do/network-reporting/get-reports/">https://www.shadowserver.org/what-we-do/network-reporting/get-reports/</a></li>

<li>All of the probes that are used in our tests are benign and do not ( and will <b>never</b> ) contain exploit code.  Scans with these types of tools are off-limits for us.</li>

<li>All the data that we collect is visible to anyone who connects to a particular host with on the proper port using the proper commands.</li>

</ul>
