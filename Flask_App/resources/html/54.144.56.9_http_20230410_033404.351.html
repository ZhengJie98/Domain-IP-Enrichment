<h1>KU Leuven Student Thesis.</h1>
<p>If you see this page, you have probably received an IPIP or GRE message from this IP Address. As part of a Master thesis, multiple IP addresses will receive an IPIP or GRE
 message which will further allow us to identify servers that use the aforementioned tunnelling protocols. The purpose of this scan is to help identify if a newly proposed
Spoofing attack using IPIP and GRE to forward messages and hide the original sender's IP is valid on today's internet.</p>

<p>The experimentation will take approximately 1 month to complete and will be over at the end of April</p>

<p>If you want to be kept out of the scan you can send me your Public IP address at the following email</p>

<p>For more information regarding the internet-wide scan you can contact me, Angelos Beitis, at angelos.beitis@student.kuleuven.be
or my supervisor Mathy Vanhoef at mathy.vanhoef@kuleuven.be</p>
