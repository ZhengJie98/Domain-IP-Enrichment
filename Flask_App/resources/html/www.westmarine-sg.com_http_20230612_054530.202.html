      <p>You are seeing this page because the domain name of this website has not been verified according to the regulations of ICANN - the body responsible for ensuring a stable and secure Internet and developing Registrar and Registrant policy.</p>
      <h3 class="info">This may be due to one of the following reasons:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>This is a new domain registration and the domain owner has yet to verify the contact name and email address.</li>
        <li>This domain has recently been transferred and the domain owner has yet to verify their contact name and email address.
        <li>The Registrant contact data on this domain has been modified and still requires verification.</li>
      </ol>
      <br />
      <h3 class="warnning">If you are the domain owner, please reactivate this domain.</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>If you want to reactivate this domain name and are the domain owner</strong> -
          please click on the link in the email that was sent to the Registrant email address on this domain.</li>
        <li><strong>If you have not received the verification email</strong> -
          please contact our technical support department to re-send it to you.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Once the Registrant contact information has been verified, this domain will be back online within 24-48 hours.</p>
      <p>If you are a visitor to this website, please try accessing it again later.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>ICANN require the Registrant contact information or modifications to Registrant contact information to be verified within 15 calendar days. If the details are not verified within this time, the domain will be suspended and will be in a pending verification status, as per ICANN mandates.</li>
        <li>Suspension is removed once WHOIS information has been successfully verified. WHOIS information must be accurate and complete. When updated the domain owner may receive a new verification email.</li>
        <li>Domain names will come back online once verified, and within an estimated period of 24-48 hours.</li>
